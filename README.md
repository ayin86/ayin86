# 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am an IT practitioner with 14 years of experience. I started out as a UI designer and gradually transitioned to a front-end developer. 

The roles I hold at work include product manager, UI design, and front-end development. 

My English reading and listening level is almost free, but my speaking and writing are not very fluent, sometimes I can't express myself very well. Trying to improve my English now.

I developed a data visualization development framework-techui. Decoration components are all implemented using dynamic SVG (no images). Almost no one does such development. Because it requires a high degree of control over the code and design ability to do it. There are currently Vue2, Vue3, and React versions.



# 🧊 Use To Code & Design

`JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `Rust`, `WebAssembly`, `React`, `Vue2`, `Vue3`, `JQuery`, `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `Less`, `DynamicSVG`, `Git`, `Bootstrap`, `AntDesign`,  `ElementUI`, `Vant`, `UniApp`, `Git`, `VSCode`, `Photoshop`, `Illustrator`, `Premiere`

#### Plan to learn

`python`,`golang`, `threejs`, may be `java`
